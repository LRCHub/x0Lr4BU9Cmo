Please stop me when
The sea I'm up again
Its not enough
To say it once

I was carried away
I was carried away
I was carried away
And i've been carried away before

And you noticed
Something darken in my eyes
The fox has broken
And the hounds are coming close behind

I was carried away
I was carried away
I was carried away
And I've been carried away before

Even after they're gone, something pushes me on...

A new morning
And I darken for the door
A bad notion
Has come over me and left once more

I was carried away
I was carried away
I was carried away
But I can't really say what for

I was carried away
I was carried away
I was carried away
And I've been carried away before

Even after they're gone, something pushes me on...

I was carried away
I was carried away
I was carried away
I was carried away
