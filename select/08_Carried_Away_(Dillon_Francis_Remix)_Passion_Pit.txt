Since my heart is golden
I've got sense to hold it
Tempted just to make an ugly scene
No I'm not as proper
My money's in copper
Ripped down from the brownstones to the street

Listen, I'm your friend (don't quote me)
But not a friend worth noting
Yes please don't ever note me as your friend

Who says we have cold hearts
Acting out our old parts
Let's perform our favorite little scene, oho

I get carried away, carried away, from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
Cause I'm sorry, sorry bout that
Sorry bout the things that I said
Always let it get to my head

All European, once again with feeling
Higher education making a sense

Justify your thesis certain that you need this
Tell me what your point is in defense

Listen, I don't really know you
And I don't think I want to
But I think I can fake it if you can

And let's agree there's no need, no more talk of money
Let's just keep pretending to be friends, oho

I get carried away, carried away, from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
Cause I'm sorry, sorry bout that
Sorry bout the things that I said
Always let it get to my head

Wake up in the morning
Wake up in the evening
Wake up when you want
Cause no one's really watching
Well she'll have something to say about it but
We all have problems
We're all having problem
And we've all got something to say

I get carried away, carried away, from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
Cause I'm sorry, sorry bout that
Sorry bout the things that I said
Always let it get to my head
